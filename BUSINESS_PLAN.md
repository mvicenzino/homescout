# HomeScout - Business Plan

## Executive Summary

**HomeScout** is an AI-powered home buying companion that transforms the chaotic home search process into an organized, confident decision-making experience. While major portals like Zillow dominate property discovery, no one owns the critical decision phase where buyers organize, compare, and choose their next home.

> "Zillow helps you find homes. HomeScout helps you choose one."

### The Opportunity
- **$1.8 trillion** in annual US residential real estate transactions
- **6+ million** households actively searching for homes at any given time
- **No dominant solution** for the organization and decision-making phase
- Buyers currently resort to spreadsheets, notes apps, and text threads

### The Solution
HomeScout provides:
- **Universal capture** from any listing site (Zillow, Redfin, Realtor.com, FSBO)
- **AI-powered analysis** for personalized affordability and investment insights
- **Household collaboration** so partners can rate and decide together
- **Smart comparison tools** to objectively evaluate options
- **Agent integration** connecting buyers with their real estate professionals

### Business Model
Freemium SaaS with monthly subscriptions (no annual contracts):
- **Buyer Premium:** $9.99/month for unlimited AI analysis and features
- **Agent Pro:** $39/month for client management and insights
- **Agent Team:** $99/month for teams and top producers
- **Partner Referrals:** Revenue share from lenders, inspectors, title companies

### Traction Goals
- **Year 1:** 25,000 users, $50K-$200K ARR
- **Year 2:** 100,000 users, $600K-$2.5M ARR
- **Year 3:** 300,000 users, $3M-$10M ARR

## The Problem

### Home Buying is Broken

The modern home buying journey is fragmented and overwhelming:

| Problem | Who Feels It | Current Workaround | Why It Fails |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Listings scattered across multiple sites | All buyers | Separate favorites on each site | No unified view, duplicates, hard to compare |
| No objective way to compare properties | Serious buyers | Spreadsheets, notes | Manual entry, no photos, no calculations |
| "Can I actually afford this?" unanswered | First-time buyers | Generic online calculators | Not personalized to individual finances |
| Partners can't easily decide together | Couples, families | Text screenshots, verbal discussions | Gets lost, no structured feedback |
| Agents lose track of client preferences | Real estate agents | CRMs, spreadsheets | Disconnected from what clients see |

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Insight:** Major portals are optimized for lead generation (selling buyer data to agents), not for helping buyers make confident decisions.

### Early Adopter Profile

- First-time or move-up home buyer, 28-45 years old
- May be buying solo, with partner, or coordinating with family
- Has saved 15+ properties across 2-3 different sites
- Feeling overwhelmed, needs organization and confidence
- Wants to know if they can actually afford their top choices

Average lifetime (months):       4-6 (realistic for home buying cycle)
Lifetime value (LTV):            $40-60
